# Predicting_Housing_Prices
Attempt to predict the median price of homes in a given Boston suburb in the mid-1970s, given data points about the suburb at the time, such as the crime rate, the local property tax rate, and so on. Only 506 data points, split between 404 training samples and 102 test samples. Each feature in the input data (for example, the crime rate) has a different scale.
